# SamOTinyApp

This is a simple app made to get practice using Android studio. It has two screens, a couple of simple widgets, 
and one use of gestures. There is little to do as a user besides switch screens. The app runs in android 6.0 and requires an
emulator or physical device to run. I used the Android API to learn the possibilities of the widgets I use in the app
as well as begin to learn other possibilites and options. 

Besides the basic overview of android studio and the android api, I learned a couple of specific and important parts 
of the development kit. Specifically, the options in controlling widgets. For example, I tried using buttons with action
listeners in the java code, as well as using the onclick property of the widget in the xml file. I also learned of some 
important limitations of the platform, specifically space and page layout.
